This game is intended for educational use.

The aim of the game is to delay the enemy units from reaching your base for as long as possible.

You can do this by placing blockades to prevent the movement of the units, and force them to reassess their route.

The game utilises 3 different searching algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A*.

For now we will only use the indestructible blockade.

You have access to two blockades: sortable and unsortable.

Sortable blockades can be 'sorted' by the units in order to break through them. This takes time, so these are best used to slow the units early on.

At the start of the game you have to place your base on the grid by clicking. It will spawn surrounded by sortable blockades.

The grid will then randomly generate some blockades.

The game will then start, and you will be able to place blockades.

Keybinds can be found on separate documentation.
