This game is intended for educational use.

The aim of the game is to delay the enemy units from reaching your base for as long as possible.

You can do this by placing blockades to prevent the movement of the units, and force them to reassess their route.

The game utilises 3 different searching algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A*.

The grid will then randomly generate some blockades.

The game will then start, and you will be able to place blockades.

Keybinds can be found on separate documentation.
